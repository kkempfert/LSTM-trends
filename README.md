This is the code for the thesis "Analyzing Trend in Daily Precipitation Time Series with Generative Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks" by Katherine Kempfert. 

The data are preprocessed wih the script "preprocess_data.R". To fit the LSTM on the data, the "template" scripts are modified automatically by running the "write" scripts. Specifically, to perform hyperparameter selection, first run "write_reparam_CV.sh", then run the resulting Python files. Then to train the LSTM on the full datasets for the best configurations from  model selection, run the "write_reparam.sh" script and the resulting Python files. The results from hyperparameter selection are analyzed with "analyze_hyperparameters.R". The results for estimation of metrics and trend analysis are obtained with "get_metrics.R".
